# A collection of compiled from source kermit version 9 binaries

Each subdirectory represents an operating system and version (e.g. `rhel-9-5` for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 9.5)
and in that directory is the kermit binary with the subdirectory appended (e.g. `kermit-rhel-9-5`).

# Security note

This repo is for my own personal use. You should really compile kermit from source yourself or download
the binary from a trusted repo from your operating system vendor.
